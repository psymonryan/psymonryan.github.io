## Writing Workflow

My writing process involves:

1. **Mind Mapping**: Using iThoughtsX to organize ideas
2. **Documentation**: Keeping a knowledge base of solutions that take >30 minutes to figure out
3. **Exporting**: Converting mind maps to Markdown
4. **Publishing**: Committing to GitHub triggers automated deployment via GitHub Actions

## Philosophy

> "If it is still in my head, it messes with my thinking. If it is in a storage system, then it is permanently searchable (and publishable)."

This blog is part of my broader documentation system that includes:

- **Daily Journal**: Chronological tracking of work and ideas
- **Projects Map**: Contextual organization of project-related information
- **Knowledge Base**: Solutions to problems that took significant time to resolve

By documenting and sharing this knowledge, I aim to:

- Help others avoid similar pitfalls
- Create a searchable archive of solutions
- Foster a community of learning and growth
